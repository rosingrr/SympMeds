Release Notes
Version 1.0
+ Added the Requirements Document
Comments:

1. Investigate on usefulness/need for this app. Talk to pharmicists or health professionals 
2. Change app name to single name that reflects the functionality or use of the app. 
3. Rewrite objectives in the requirements documents as discussed during our lab meeting (why do you need this app?)
4. Update the "statement of functionality". Give an overview of the project before explaining features.
5. Start thinking about how to create a database. Manual creation is tedious and time-consuming. Look for pointers/resources in NIH and CDC websites.
6. Research on other apps that are similar to yours and update the requirements document under "replacement of legacy systems"
