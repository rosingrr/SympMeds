Finished all implementation of app.
Did some refactoring:
	changed the onCreate method for the following classes:
		MainActivity.java
			added public variable that holds the workbook from the database file so the other activities don't have to open the file each time
		SymptomList.java
			calls on the MainActivity's public variable instead of opening the database
			replaced any "magic numbers" with constants
			changed some variable names to make them more descriptive
		DrugList.java
			same as above
		DrugInfo.java
			same as above
Still working on testing and increasing database.
Have problem getting code coverage working.

comments:
1)check in UI/Database Changes from Milena
2)complete test suite
3)get code coverage working
